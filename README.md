# CarloVirdis_FinalProject
This is the idea for my final Unity project

Game name: “Dopamine Run”
 a videogame inspired by “Dopamine” Album by Sick Luke

Short Project Introduction:
 Sick Luke is one of the most influential artists and producers in today’s Italian music scene, 
 renowned for his ability to blend trap, hip-hop, and experimental sounds with a distinctive futuristic aesthetic.
 His latest album “Dopamine” (released in September 2025) explores dopamine as a metaphor for the modern human drive toward stimulation, excitement, and emotional highs.
 The project is defined by a technological identity, evoking a cybernetic, synthetic, and futuristic atmosphere.

 My goal is to draw inspiration from the album “Dopamine” to create a videogame as a tribute to Sick Luke, 
 eventually producing a draft that I could share with him in case he might be interested in turning the idea into reality.

Concept and Gameplay:
 Since this is my first complete project developed in Unity, my aim is to keep the mechanics relatively simple while ensuring the experience remains engaging and  stylistically coherent.
 I plan to integrate the knowledge I acquired during course assignments, while   still experimenting in order to create something new.

Main Character:
 The player controls a character representing Sick Luke. 
 I plan to create this avatar using ReadyPlayerMe (with Mixamo for the animations) and import it into Unity.
 I will also integrate my 3D modeling skills in Blender, adopting a low-poly aesthetic that reflects the album’s visual style.

Environment Style:
 Inspired by the cover of “Dopamine”, the game environment will adopt a technological, cyber-futuristic look.

Gameplay Mechanics:
The player will move forward (3D endless runner style) plus jumping.


Collectible items: 
 (Dopamine Coins) & (Power-Ups) and possible obstacles will appear randomly and must be avoided, the player can use the power-ups to become immune for 5–8 seconds.
  
A Dopamine Coins counter motivates the player.


Music Integration / Sound Design:
 The game will be accompanied by tracks from the album Dopamina.
 I will try to make the experience feel more natural. I will also add additional sounds, such as effects for jumping or collecting power-ups.

Technical Features: 
 Low-poly 3D Assets: imported into Unity.
 Randomized Elements: enemies and power-ups generated dynamically during gameplay.

UI Design:
 Start Screen (Game Title + “Press Start”). 
 Game Over Screen (with Restart option)
 Timer
